# Continuous Learning Agenda
- Dates: 5/28 - 5/30 (No meeting 5/29) 11:30AM - 1PM EST
- Topic: AI Assisted Development

## Day 1 - 5/28(Tuesday)
- What is AI/ML?
- Generative AI Intro
  - What the heck is LLM?
  - Word Embedding is a vector representation of text (dimension depends on each model) -> This allows models to compare words based on meanings instead of exclusively depending on spelling
  - Vector conversion algo (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc)
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG architecture): LLM + VectorDB(that has additional data)
  - Tokens
  - Prompts
  - Other GenAI Models (Dall-E, multimodal like GPT-4)
- LLM Issues
  - Stochastic Output (Temperature)
  - Logging and monitoring
  - Hallucination (and [legal ramifications](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/))

  - Prompt Injection
  - Jailbreak
- HuggingFace
