# Project 1

## Overview (Due: 4/19/24)

For this project, you'll create an ASP.NET Core project, where the application will be interacting with users via HTTP call. The project will conclude with a presentation of working software to trainers and colleagues.

You may refactor your P0 or start a brand new one

## Requirements
- The application should be ASP.NET Core application
- The application should build and run
- The application should have unit tests and at least 20% coverage
- The application should communicate via HTTP(s)
- The application should be RESTful API
- The application should persist data to a SQL Server DB
- The application should communicate to DB via EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

## Presentation
You can either demo just API or have a frontend (either a C# Console App, or web front end, your choice)
