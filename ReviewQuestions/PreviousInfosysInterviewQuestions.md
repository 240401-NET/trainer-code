## Interview 2
They bombarded me with behavioral questions and grilled me about my projects. The spotlight was definitely on the backend and SQL. Stuff like explaining stored procedures, breaking down MVC, and even throwing in a curveball about version control. I made sure to cover all bases in my answers, maybe that's why they didn't throw too many curveballs at me!

Here are some of the questions they threw at me:

- "Where do you picture yourself in five years?"  
- "How do you tackle new tech challenges in the workplace?"

And then, they hit me with these technical gems:

- "What's your go-to syntax for connecting to a database?"  
- "Explain a stored procedure to me like I'm five."  
- "Break down MVC for us."  
- "Give us the scoop on exception handling in C#."  
- "Share a story about when you rocked unit testing."

- .NET version? Angular version?
- How can you connect your database in .NET?

- For EF, would you prefer code first or data first?
- Unit testing 3As?
- Tell me about the unit test framework you used in your project and how you used it?

-asked if i've deployed an app and how
-asked about source control and what i've done with it
-what is a pk? fk?

Most of my questions were just about all the stuff i did besides revature so most of my questions werent even in scope

and also they explained how infosys works and asked how willing I would be to adapt to the situation (lots of timezones coordinating to get something working)
